                        need — and what they complain about when agencies don't deliver. 4+ years running the marketing
                        engine for a multi-location family law practice.</p>

                        because I was the client evaluating your proposals, reviewing your work, and documenting when
                        things went sideways. 4+ years coordinating agencies, tracking accountability, and QA-ing
                        deliverables.</p>

                        running the full marketing operation for a 14-location firm. One person who knows the whole

                        what separates the vendors we kept from the ones we fired.</p>

                        broke. I don't guess what legal marketers need. I was the legal marketer.</p>
